=== Enabling Interceptors

Only interceptors that are enabled are
eligible to be invoked.

Interceptors declared using interceptor
bindings are enabled using the Priority annotation (see Section
<<use_of_the_priority_annotation_in_ordering_interceptors>>).
The _Priority_ annotation also controls
interceptor ordering (see Section 5.2 <<interceptor_ordering_rules>>).

Interceptors declared using the
_Interceptors_ annotation are enabled by that annotation. Using the
_Interceptors_ annotation to associate interceptor classes with a target
class or a method or constructor of a target class enables them for that
target class, method, or constructor. The order in which the interceptor
classes are specified in the _Interceptors_ annotation controls
interceptor ordering (see Section 5.2 <<interceptor_ordering_rules>>).
Interceptor methods declared in the target
class or in a superclass of the target class are enabled unless
overridden.

An extension specification may define
alternative mechanisms (e.g., a deployment descriptor such as the CDI
beans.xml [<<bib3>>] or the Enterprise Jakarta Beans _ejb-jar.xml_
deployment descriptor [<<bib2>>]) to
enable and order interceptors, to override the order specified by means
of annotations, or to disable interceptors.

_Note: The InvocationContext object allows
interceptor methods to control the behavior of the invocation chain,
including whether the next method in the chain is invoked and the values
of its parameters and result. See Section 2.4
<<invocation_context>>._

[[interceptor_ordering_rules]]
=== Interceptor Ordering Rules

For each interceptor method type (i.e.,
around-invoke, around-timeout, post-construct, etc.), the following
interceptor invocation ordering rules apply, except as specified
otherwise by an extension specification.

- Default interceptors are invoked first.

- Default interceptors are invoked in the order
defined by the extension specification (e.g., by their order in the
deployment descriptor).

- If a default interceptor class has
superclasses, interceptor methods declared in the interceptor class’s
superclasses are invoked before the interceptor method declared in the
interceptor class itself, most general superclass first.

- Interceptors declared by applying the
Interceptors annotation _at class-level_ to the target class are invoked
next.

- Interceptor methods declared in the
interceptor classes listed in the _Interceptors_ annotation are invoked
in the same order as the specification of the interceptor classes in
that annotation.

- If an interceptor class declared by applying
the Interceptors annotation _at class-level_ has superclasses,
interceptor methods declared in the interceptor class’s superclasses are
invoked before the interceptor method declared in the interceptor class
itself, most general superclass first.

NOTE: This specification does not define
the semantics of applying the Interceptors annotation to a superclass of
the target class, and thus the corresponding interceptor methods may or
may not be invoked. Applications that specify the Interceptors
annotation on a superclass of the target class will not be portable.

- Interceptors declared by applying the
Interceptors annotation _at method- or constructor-level_ are invoked
next.

- Interceptor methods declared in the
interceptor classes listed in the _Interceptors_ annotation are invoked
in the same order as the specification of the interceptor classes in
that annotation.

- If an interceptor class declared by applying
the Interceptors annotation _at method- or constructor-level_ has
superclasses, interceptor methods declared in the interceptor class’s
superclasses are invoked before the interceptor method declared in the
interceptor class itself, most general superclass first.

- Interceptors declared using interceptor
bindings are invoked next.

- All interceptors specified using interceptor
binding annotations visible on the target class (e.g., specified on the
class or visible on the class because they were declared with the
`Inherited` annotation) are combined with all binding annotations on the
target method and sorted by the priorities specified by the `Priority`
annotation; and then the interceptor methods are invoked in order of
priority. The `Priority` annotation is described in Section
<<use_of_the_priority_annotation_in_ordering_interceptors>>.

- If an interceptor class declared using
interceptor bindings has superclasses, interceptor methods declared in
the interceptor class’s superclasses are invoked before the interceptor
method declared in the interceptor class itself, most general superclass
first.

- Interceptor methods declared in the target
class or in any superclass of the target class are invoked last.

- If the target class has superclasses,
interceptor methods declared in the target class’s superclasses are
invoked before an interceptor method declared in the target class
itself, most general superclass first.

- If an interceptor method is overridden by
another method (regardless whether that method is itself an interceptor
method), it will not be invoked.

[[use_of_the_priority_annotation_in_ordering_interceptors]]
==== Use of the Priority Annotation in Ordering Interceptors

The `Priority` annotation can be used to
enable and order interceptors associated with components that use
interceptor bindings. The required `value` element of the `Priority`
annotation determines the ordering. Interceptors with smaller priority
values are called first. If more than one interceptor has the same
priority, the relative order of those interceptors is undefined.

[source, java]
----
@Monitored @Interceptor @Priority(100)
public class MonitoringInterceptor {
    @AroundInvoke
    public Object monitorInvocation(InvocationContext ctx)
        throws Exception { ... }
}
----

The Priority annotation is ignored when
computing the invocation order of interceptors bound to a component
using the Interceptors annotation.

The following priority values are defined for
interceptor ordering when used with the Priority annotation.
Interceptors with lower priority values are invoked earlier in the
interceptor chain.

- `Interceptor.Priority.PLATFORM_BEFORE` = 0

- `Interceptor.Priority.LIBRARY_BEFORE` = 1000

- `Interceptor.Priority.APPLICATION` = 2000

- `Interceptor.Priority.LIBRARY_AFTER` = 3000

- `Interceptor.Priority.PLATFORM_AFTER` = 4000

These values define the following interceptor
ranges to order interceptors for a specific interposed method or event
in the interceptor chain:

- Interceptors defined by the Jakarta EE Platform
specifications that are to be executed at the beginning of the
interceptor chain should have priority values in the range
`PLATFORM_BEFORE` up until `LIBRARY_BEFORE`.

- Interceptors defined by extension libraries
that are intended to be executed earlier in the interceptor chain, but
after interceptors in the range up until `LIBRARY_BEFORE` should have
priority values in the range `LIBRARY_BEFORE` up until `APPLICATION`.

- Interceptors defined by applications should
be in the range APPLICATION up until `LIBRARY_AFTER`.

- Interceptors defined by extension libraries
that are intended to be executed later in the interceptor chain should
have priority values in the range `LIBRARY_AFTER` up until `PLATFORM_AFTER`.

- Interceptors defined by the Jakarta EE Platform
specifications that are to be executed at the end of the interceptor
chain should have priority values at `PLATFORM_AFTER` or higher.

- An interceptor that must be invoked before or
after another defined interceptor can choose any appropriate value.

Negative priority values are reserved for
future use by this specification and should not be used.

The following example defines an extension
library interceptor that is to be executed before any application
interceptor, but after any early platform interceptor:

[source, java]
----
@Priority(Interceptor.Priority.LIBRARY_BEFORE+10)
@Interceptor
public class ValidationInterceptor { ... }
----

[[excluding_interceptors]]
=== Excluding Interceptors

Interceptors may be excluded from execution
by means of the `ExcludeClassInterceptors` annotation and the
`ExcludeDefaultInterceptors` annotation.

The `ExcludeClassInterceptors` annotation can
be used to exclude the invocation of the class-level interceptors
defined by means of the `Interceptors` annotation.

The `ExcludeDefaultInterceptors` annotation
can be used to exclude the invocation of default interceptors for a
target class or—when applied to a target class constructor or method—to
exclude the invocation of default interceptors for a particular
constructor or method.

An extension specification may define other
means for excluding interceptors from execution, such as by means of a
deployment descriptor.



In the following example interceptors will be
invoked in the following order when `someMethod` is called:
`SomeInterceptor`, `AnotherInterceptor`, `MyInterceptor`.

[source, java]
----
@Stateless
@Interceptors({org.acme.SomeInterceptor.class,
               org.acme.AnotherInterceptor.class})
public class MyBean {
    ...
    @Interceptors(org.acme.MyInterceptor.class)
    public void someMethod() {
        ...
    }
}
----

In the following example only the interceptor
`MyInterceptor` will be invoked when `someMethod` is called. The
`ExcludeClassInterceptors` annotation is used to exclude the invocation
of the class-level interceptors.

[source, java]
----
@Stateless
@Interceptors(org.acme.AnotherInterceptor.class)
public class MyBean {
    ...
    @Interceptors(org.acme.MyInterceptor.class)
    @ExcludeClassInterceptors
    public void someMethod() {
        ...
    }
}
----

In the next example, only the interceptor
`MyInterceptor` will be invoked when `someMethod` is called. The
`ExcludeDefaultInterceptors` annotation is used to exclude the
invocation of the default interceptors (if any).

[source, java]
----
@Stateless
public class MyBean {
    ...
    @ExcludeDefaultInterceptors
    @Interceptors(org.acme.MyInterceptor.class)
    public void someMethod() {
        ...
    }
}
----
