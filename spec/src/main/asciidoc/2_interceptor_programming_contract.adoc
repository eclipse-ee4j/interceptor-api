== Interceptor Programming Contract

[[terminology]]
=== Terminology

The following terminology is used in this
document:

-  `Interceptor class` : a class containing
interceptor methods that is designed to be associated with a target
class, method, or constructor.

-  `Interceptor`: instance of an interceptor
class.

- `Interceptor method` : a method of an
interceptor class or of a target class that is invoked to interpose on
the invocation of a method of the target class, a constructor of the
target class, a lifecycle event of the target class, or a timeout method
of the target class.

[[definition_of_interceptor_classes_and_interceptor_methods]]
=== Definition of Interceptor Classes and Interceptor Methods

An interceptor method for a target class may
be declared in the target class, in an interceptor class associated with
the target class, or in a superclass of the target class or interceptor
class.

Any number of interceptor classes may be
associated with a target class. See Chapter
<<interceptor_ordering>> for rules on
interceptor ordering.

An interceptor class must not be `abstract` and
must have a `public` no-arg constructor.

This specification defines the interceptor
method types listed below. Extension specifications may define
additional interceptor method types.

- Around-invoke interceptor methods (annotated
with the `jakarta.interceptor.AroundInvoke` annotation). Around-invoke
interceptor methods interpose on the invocation of business methods.

- Around-timeout interceptor methods (annotated
with the `jakarta.interceptor.AroundTimeout` annotation). Around-timeout
interceptor methods interpose on the invocation of timeout methods, in
response to timer events.

- Post-construct interceptor methods (annotated
with the `jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct` annotation). Post-construct
interceptor methods are invoked after dependency injection has been
completed on the target instance.

- Pre-destroy interceptor methods (annotated
with the `jakarta.annotation.PreDestroy` annotation). Pre-destroy
interceptor methods are invoked before the target instance and all
interceptor instances associated with it are destroyed by the container.

- Around-construct interceptor methods
(annotated with the `jakarta.interceptor.AroundConstruct` annotation).
Around-construct interceptor methods interpose on the invocation of the
constructor of the target instance.

Post-construct, pre-destroy, and
around-construct interceptor methods are collectively referred to as
_lifecycle callback interceptor methods_ . Extension specifications may
define additional lifecycle callback events and lifecycle callback
interceptor method types.

Up to one interceptor method of each
interceptor method type may be defined in the same class. More
specifically, up to one around-invoke interceptor method, one
around-timeout interceptor method, and one lifecycle callback
interceptor method for each of the different lifecycle events may be
defined in the same class. Only the interceptor methods of the
interceptor class that are relevant for the given invocation context are
invoked. For example, when a business method is invoked, around-invoke
interceptor methods are invoked, but any around-construct,
around-timeout, post-construct, or pre-destroy methods are ignored.

A single interceptor method may be defined to
interpose on any combination of business methods, timeout methods, and
lifecycle callback events.

Interceptor methods and interceptor classes
may be defined for a class by means of metadata annotations or,
optionally, by means of a deployment descriptor.

Interceptor classes may be associated with
the target class using either interceptor binding annotations (see
<<associating_interceptors_with_classes_and_methods_using_interceptor_bindings>>) or the
_jakarta.interceptor.Interceptors_ annotation (see
<<associating_interceptors_with_classes_and_methods_using_the_interceptors_annotation>>). Typically only
one interceptor association type is used for any target class.

An extension specification may use a
deployment descriptor to specify the invocation order of interceptors or
to override the order specified in metadata annotations. A deployment
descriptor can optionally be used to define interceptors, to define
default interceptors, or to associate interceptors with a target class.
For example, the Enterprise Jakarta Beans specification [<<bib2>>] requires support for the
`ejb-jar.xml` deployment descriptor and the CDI specification
[<<bib3>>] requires support for the `beans.xml`
deployment descriptor.

[[interceptor_life_cycle]]
=== Interceptor Life Cycle

The lifecycle of an interceptor instance is
the same as that of the target instance with which it is associated.

Except as noted below, when the target
instance is created, a corresponding instance is created for each
associated interceptor class. These interceptor instances are destroyed
if the target instance fails to be created or when the target instance
is destroyed by the container.

An interceptor instance may be the target of
dependency injection. Dependency injection is performed when the
interceptor instance is created, using the naming context of the
associated target class.

With the exception of aroundConstruct
lifecycle callback interceptor methods, no interceptor methods are
invoked until after dependency injection has been completed on both the
interceptor instances and the target footnote:[If a PostConstruct
interceptor method is declared in the interceptor class or a superclass
of the interceptor class, it is not invoked when the interceptor
instance itself is created.].

Post-construct interceptor methods for the
target instance are invoked after dependency injection has been
completed on the target instance.

Pre-destroy interceptor methods are
invoked before the target instance and all interceptor instances
associated with it are destroyed.footnote:[If a PreDestroy
interceptor method is declared in the interceptor class or a superclass
of the interceptor class, it is not invoked when the interceptor
instance itself is destroyed.]

The following rules apply specifically to
around-construct lifecycle callback interceptor methods:

- Around-construct lifecycle callback
interceptor methods are invoked after dependency injection has been
completed on the instances of all interceptor classes associated with
the target class. Injection of the target component into interceptor
instances that are invoked during the around-construct lifecycle
callback is not supported.

- The target instance is created `after` the
last interceptor method in the around-construct interceptor chain
invokes the `InvocationContext.proceed` method. If the constructor for the
target instance supports injection, such constructor injection is
performed. If the `InvocationContext.proceed` method is not invoked by an
interceptor method, the target instance will not be created.

- An around-construct interceptor method can
access the constructed instance using the `InvocationContext.getTarget`
method after the `InvocationContext.proceed` method completes.

- Dependency injection on the target instance
other than constructor injection is not completed until after the
invocations of all interceptor methods in the around-construct
interceptor chain complete successfully. Around-construct lifecycle
callback interceptor methods should therefore exercise caution when
invoking methods of the target instance since dependency injection on
the target instance will not have been completed.

[[interceptor_environment]]
==== Interceptor Environment

An interceptor class shares the enterprise
naming context of its associated target class. Annotations and/or XML
deployment descriptor elements for dependency injection or for direct
JNDI lookup refer to this shared naming context.

Around-invoke and around-timeout interceptor
methods run in the same Java thread as the associated target method.
Around-construct interceptor methods run in the same Java thread as the
target constructor.

It is possible to carry state across multiple
interceptor method invocations for a single method invocation or
lifecycle callback event in the context data of the `InvocationContext`
object. The `InvocationContext` object also provides information that
enables interceptor methods to control the behavior of the interceptor
invocation chain, including whether the next method in the chain is
invoked and the values of its parameters and result.

[[invocation_context]]
=== Invocation Context

The `InvocationContext` object provides
information that enables interceptor methods to control the behavior of
the invocation chain.

[source, java]
----
public interface InvocationContext {
 public Object getTarget();
 public Object getTimer();
 public Method getMethod();
 public Constructor<?> getConstructor();
 public Object[] getParameters();
 public void setParameters(Object[] params);
 public java.util.Map<String, Object> getContextData();
 public Object proceed() throws Exception;
}
----


The same `InvocationContext` instance is
passed to each interceptor method for a given target class method or
lifecycle event interception.

The `InvocationContext` instance allows an
interceptor method to save information in the `Map` obtained via the
`getContextData` method. This information can subsequently be retrieved
and/or updated by other interceptor methods in the invocation chain, and
thus serves as a means to pass contextual data between interceptors. The
contextual data is not sharable across separate target class method or
or lifecycle callback event invocations. The lifecycle of the
`InvocationContext` instance is otherwise unspecified.

If interceptor methods are invoked as a
result of the invocation on a web service endpoint, the map returned by
`getContextData` will be the JAX-WS `MessageContext` [<<bib4>>].

The `getTarget` method returns the associated
target instance. For around-construct lifecycle callback interceptor
methods, getTarget returns null if called before the proceed method
returns.

The `getTimer` method returns the timer
object associated with a timeout method invocation. The _getTimer_
method returns null for interceptor method types other than
around-timeout interceptor methods.

The `getMethod` method returns the method of
the target class for which the current interceptor method was invoked.
The `getMethod` returns null in a lifecycle callback interceptor method
for which there is no corresponding lifecycle callback method declared
in the target class (or inherited from a superclass) or in an
around-construct lifecycle callback interceptor method.

The `getConstructor` method returns the
constructor of the target class for which the current around-construct
interceptor method was invoked. The `getConstructor` method returns null
for interceptor method types other than around-construct interceptor
methods.

The `getParameters` method returns the
parameters of the method or constructor invocation. If the
`setParameters` method has been called, `getParameters` returns the
values to which the parameters have been set.

The `setParameters` method modifies the
parameters used for the invocation of the target class method or
constructor. Modifying the parameter values does not affect the
determination of the method or the constructor that is invoked on the
target class. The parameter types must match the types for the target
class method or constructor, and the number of parameters supplied must
equal the number of parameters on the target class method or constructor footnote:[If the last parameter
is a vararg parameter of type T, it is considered be equivalent to a
parameter of type T{opening-bracket}{closing-bracket}.],
or the `IllegalArgumentException` is
thrown to the `setParameters` call.

The `proceed` method causes the invocation of
the next interceptor method in the chain or, when called from the last
around-invoke or around-timeout interceptor method, the target class
method. For around-construct lifecycle callback interceptor methods, the
invocation of the `proceed` method in the last interceptor method in the
chain causes the target instance to be created. Interceptor methods must
always call the `InvocationContext.proceed` method or no subsequent
interceptor methods, target class method, or lifecycle callback methods
will be invoked, or—in the case of around-construct interceptor
methods—the target instance will not be created. The `proceed` method
returns the result of the next method invoked. If a method is of type
`void` , the invocation of the `proceed` method returns `null` . For
around-construct lifecycle callback interceptor methods, the invocation
of proceed in the last interceptor method in the chain causes the target
instance to be created. For all other lifecycle callback interceptor
methods, if there is no lifecycle callback interceptor method defined on
the target class, the invocation of `proceed` in the last interceptor
method in the chain is a no-op footnote:[In case of the
PostConstruct interceptor, if there is no callback method defined on the
target class, the invocation of InvocationContext.proceed method in
the last interceptor method in the chain validates the target instance.],
and `null` is returned.

[[exceptions]]
=== Exceptions

Interceptor methods are allowed to throw
runtime exceptions or any checked exceptions that the associated target
method or constructor allows within its `throws` clause.

Interceptor methods are allowed to catch and
suppress exceptions and to recover by calling the
`InvocationContext.proceed` method.

The invocation of the
`InvocationContext.proceed` method throws the same exception as any
thrown by the associated target method unless an interceptor method
further down the Java call stack has caught it and thrown a different
exception or suppressed the exception. Exceptions and initialization
and/or cleanup operations should typically be handled in
`try/catch/finally` blocks around the `proceed` method.

[[business_method_interceptor_methods]]
=== Business Method Interceptor Methods

Interceptor methods that interpose on
business method invocations are denoted by the `AroundInvoke`
annotation.

Around-invoke methods may be declared in
interceptor classes, in the superclasses of interceptor classes, in the
target class, and/or in superclasses of the target class. However, only
one around-invoke method may be declared in a given class.

Around-invoke methods can have `public` ,
`private` , `protected` , or `package` level access. An around-invoke
method must not be declared as `abstract, final or static` .

Around-invoke methods have the following
signature:

 Object <METHOD>(InvocationContext)

_Note: An around-invoke interceptor method may
be declared to throw any checked exceptions that the associated target
method allows within its throws clause. It may be declared to throw the
java.lang.Exception, for example, if it interposes on several methods
that can throw unrelated checked exceptions._

An around-invoke method can invoke any
component or resource that the method it is intercepting can invoke.

In general, an around-invoke method
invocation occurs within the same transaction and security context as
the method on which it is interposing. However, note that the
transaction context may be changed by transactional interceptor methods
in the invocation chain, such as those defined by the `Jakarta Transaction
API` specification [<<bib7>>].

The following example defines
`MonitoringInterceptor`, which is used to interpose on `ShoppingCart`
business methods:

[source, java]
----
@Inherited
@InterceptorBinding
@Target({TYPE, METHOD})
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Monitored {}

@Monitored @Interceptor
public class MonitoringInterceptor {
    @AroundInvoke
    public Object monitorInvocation(InvocationContext ctx) {
        //... log invocation data ...
        return ctx.proceed();
    }
}

@Monitored
public class ShoppingCart {
    public void placeOrder(Order o) {
        ...
    }
}
----

=== Interceptor Methods for Lifecycle Event Callbacks

The `AroundConstruct` annotation specifies a
lifecycle callback interceptor method that interposes on the invocation
of the target instance’s constructor.

The `PostConstruct` annotation specifies a
lifecycle callback interceptor method that is invoked after the target
instance has been constructed and dependency injection on that instance
has been completed, but before any business method or other event, such
as a timer event, is invoked on the target instance.

The `PreDestroy` annotation specifies a
lifecycle callback interceptor method that interposes on the target
instance’s removal by the container.

Extension specifications are permitted to
define additional lifecycle events and lifecycle callback interceptor
methods types.

Around-construct interceptor methods may be
only declared in interceptor classes and/or superclasses of interceptor
classes. Around-construct interceptor methods must not be declared in
the target class or in its superclasses.

All other lifecycle callback interceptor
methods can be declared in an interceptor class, superclass of an
interceptor class, in the target class, and/or in a superclass of the
target class.

A single lifecycle callback interceptor
method may be used to interpose on multiple lifecycle callback events.

A given class may not have more than one
lifecycle callback interceptor method for the same lifecycle event. Any
subset or combination of lifecycle callback annotations may otherwise be
specified on methods declared in a given class.

Lifecycle callback interceptor methods are
invoked in an unspecified security context. Lifecycle callback
interceptor methods are invoked in a transaction context determined by
their target class and/or method footnote:[In general, a
lifecycle callback interceptor method will be invoked in an unspecified
transaction context. Note however that singleton and stateful session
beans support the use of a transaction context for the invocation of
lifecycle callback interceptor methods (see the Jakarta Enterprise
Beans specification &#91;<<bib2>>&#93;). The
transaction context may be also changed by transactional interceptors in
the invocation chain.].

Lifecycle callback interceptor methods can
have `public` , `private` , `protected` , or `package` level access. A
lifecycle callback interceptor method must not be declared as abstract
or `final` . A lifecycle callback interceptor method must not be
declared as `static` except in an application client.

Lifecycle callback interceptor methods
declared in an interceptor class or superclass of an interceptor class
must have one of the following signatures:

 void <METHOD>(InvocationContext)
 Object <METHOD>(InvocationContext)

_Note: A lifecycle callback interceptor method
may be declared to throw checked exceptions including the
java.lang.Exception if the same interceptor method interposes on
business or timeout methods in addition to lifecycle events. If such an
interceptor method returns a value, the value is ignored by the
container when the method is invoked to interpose on a lifecycle event._

Lifecycle callback interceptor methods
declared in a target class or in a superclass of a target class must
have the following signature:

 void <METHOD>()

The following example declares lifecycle
callback interceptor methods in both the interceptor class and the
target class. Rules for interceptor ordering are described in chapter 5
<<interceptor_ordering>>.

[source, java]
----
public class MyInterceptor {
    ...
    @PostConstruct
    public void someMethod(InvocationContext ctx) {
        ...
        ctx.proceed();
        ...
    }
     @PreDestroy
     public void someOtherMethod(InvocationContext ctx) {
        ...
        ctx.proceed();
        ...
     }
}


@Interceptors(MyInterceptor.class)
@Stateful
public class ShoppingCartBean implements ShoppingCart {
    private float total;
    private Vector productCodes;
    ...
    public int someShoppingMethod() {
        ...
    }
    @PreDestroy void endShoppingCart() {
        ...
    }
}
----

[[exceptions_life_cicle_event_callbacks]]
==== Exceptions

When invoked to interpose on lifecycle
events, lifecycle callback interceptor methods may throw runtime
exceptions, but—except for around-construct methods—may not throw
checked exceptions.

In addition to the rules specified in section 2.5
<<exceptions>>, the following rules
apply to the lifecycle callback interceptor methods:

- A lifecycle callback interceptor method
declared in an interceptor class or in a superclass of an interceptor
class may catch an exception thrown by another lifecycle callback
interceptor method in the invocation chain, and clean up before
returning.

- Pre-destroy interceptor methods are not
invoked when the target instance and the interceptors are discarded as a
result of such exceptions: the lifecycle callback interceptor methods in
the chain should perform any necessary clean-up operations as the
interceptor chain unwinds.

[[timeout_method_interceptor_methods]]
=== Timeout Method Interceptor Methods

Interceptor methods that interpose on timeout
methods are denoted by the `AroundTimeout` annotation.

_Note: Timeout methods are currently specific
to Jakarta Enterprise Beans, although Timer Service functionality may be
extended to other specifications in the future, and extension
specifications may define events that may be interposed on by
around-timeout methods. The Timer Service, defined by the Jakarta Enterprise
Beans specification [<<bib2>>], is a container-provided service
that allows the Bean Provider to register enterprise beans for timer
callbacks according to a calendar-based schedule, at a specified time,
after a specified elapsed time, or at specified intervals. The timer
callbacks registered with the Timer Service are called timeout methods._

Around-timeout methods may be declared in
interceptor classes, in superclasses of interceptor classes, in the
target class, and/or in superclasses of the target class. However, only
one around-timeout method may be declared in a given class.

Around-timeout methods can have `public` ,
`private` , `protected` , or `package` level access. An around-timeout
method must not be declared as abstract, `final` or `static` .

Around-timeout methods have the following
signature:

 Object <METHOD>(InvocationContext)

_Note: An around-timeout interceptor method
should not throw application exceptions, but it may be declared to throw
checked exceptions or the java.lang.Exception if the same interceptor
method interposes on business methods in addition to the timeout
methods._

An around-timeout method can invoke any
component or resource that its corresponding timeout method can invoke.

An around-timeout method invocation occurs
within the same transaction footnote:[Note that the
transaction context may be changed by transactional interceptors in the
invocation chain.] and security context
as the timeout method on which it is interposing.

The `InvocationContext.getTimer` method
allows an around-timeout method to retrieve the timer object associated
with the timeout.

In the following example around-timeout
interceptor is associated with two timeout methods:

[source, java]
----
public class MyInterceptor {
    private Logger logger = ...;

    @AroundTimeout
    private Object aroundTimeout(InvocationContext ctx)
            throws Exception {
        logger.info("processing: " + ctx.getTimer().getInfo());
        return ctx.proceed();
        ...
    }
}


@Interceptors(MyInterceptor.class)
@Singleton
public class CacheBean {
    private Data data;

    @Schedule(minute="*/30",hour="*",info="update-cache")
    public void refresh(Timer t) {
        data.refresh();
    }

    @Schedule(dayOfMonth="1",info="validate-cache")
    public void validate(Timer t) {
        data.validate();
    }
}
----

[[constructor_and_method_level_interceptors]]
=== Constructor- and Method-level Interceptors

Method-level interceptors are interceptor
classes directly associated with a specific business or timeout method
of the target class. Constructor-level interceptors are interceptor
classes directly associated with a constructor of the target class.

For example, an around-invoke interceptor
method may be applied only to a specific business method of the target
class— independent of the other methods of the target class—by using a
method-level interceptor. Likewise, an around-timeout interceptor method
may be applied only to a specific timeout method on the target class,
independent of the other timeout methods of the target class.

Method-level interceptors may not be
associated with a lifecycle callback method of the target class.

The same interceptor may be applied to more
than one business or timeout method of the target class.

If a method-level interceptor is applied to
more than one method of a associated target class this does not affect
the relationship between the interceptor instance and the target
class—only a single instance of the interceptor class is created per
target class instance.

In the following example only the placeOrder
method will be monitored:

[source, java]
----
public class ShoppingCart {
    @Monitored
    public void placeOrder() {
         ...
    }
}
----

In the following example, the MyInterceptor
interceptor is applied to a subset of the business methods of the
session bean. _Note_ that the created and removed methods of the
MyInterceptor interceptor will not be invoked:

[source, java]
----
public class MyInterceptor {
    ...
    @AroundInvoke
    public Object around_invoke(InvocationContext ctx) { ... }

     @PostConstruct
     public void created(InvocationContext ctx) { ... }

     @PreDestroy
     public void removed(InvocationContext ctx) { ... }
}

@Stateless
public class MyBean {
     @PostConstruct
     void init() { ... }

     public void notIntercepted() { ... }

     @Interceptors(org.acme.MyInterceptor.class)
     public void someMethod() { ... }

     @Interceptors(org.acme.MyInterceptor.class)
     public void anotherMethod() { ... }
}
----

In the following example, the
`ValidationInterceptor` interceptor interposes on the bean constructor
only, and the `validateMethod` interceptor method will not be invoked:

[source, java]
----
@Inherited
@InterceptorBinding
@Target({CONSTRUCTOR, METHOD})
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface ValidateSpecial {}

@ValidateSpecial
public class ValidationInterceptor {
     @AroundConstruct
     public void validateConstructor(InvocationContext ctx) { ... }

     @AroundInvoke
    public Object validateMethod(InvocationContext ctx) { ... }
}

public class SomeBean {
    @ValidateSpecial
    SomeBean(...) {
        ...
    }

    public void someMethod() {
        ...
    }
}
----

In the following example, the
`validateConstructor` method of the `ValidationInterceptor` interceptor
interposes on the bean constructor, and the `validateMethod` method of
the interceptor interposes on the `anotherMethod` business method of the
bean.

[source, java]
----
public class SomeBean {
    @ValidateSpecial
    SomeBean(...) {
        ...
    }

    public void someMethod() {
        ...
    }

    @ValidateSpecial
    public void anotherMethod() {
        ...
    }
}
----

[[default_interceptors]]
=== Default Interceptors

Default interceptors are interceptors that
apply to a set of target classes. An extension specification may support
the use of a deployment descriptor or annotations to define default
interceptors and their relative ordering.
